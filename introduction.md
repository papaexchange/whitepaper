# Introduction

In 2008, the way that the world viewed value was forever transformed by the anonymous forefather of all cryptocurrencies, Satoshi Nakamoto. What began simply as a new standard for digital transfer through Bitcoin has now rapidly expanded to include a myriad of altcoins vying for attention; as well as new concepts such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), and decentralized trading infrastructure. In mainstream media, it’s widely reported that the cryptocurrency space has been on a rocket to the moon, albeit with the volatility that is to be expected when revolutionary technology and disruptive new ways of doing things are unveiled to the world.\


However, most current cryptocurrency projects to date have been built to benefit and reward those already in the industry and community. Their aim has generally been to make processes on existing chains faster and more secure, or incur less fees, especially in the DeFi space. For most common folks who aren’t crypto savvy, they’ve been left out of the ecosystem.\


Conversely, PapaExchange is designed to finally bring everything in to one place. PapaExchange connects end users to possibilities beyond there reach by traditional centralised and decentralised exchanges, By doing so, PapaExchange creates opportunities to everyone. PapaExchange brings these opportunities to the people who need it most, employees and their families, borrowers, and entrepreneurs, along with making vital real-world assets such as natural capital more accessible through fractional tokenization and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\


Here, we introduce the key founding principles of PapaExchange. To begin, we will explore the problems and inefficiencies that have existed in the space to date.
