# Problem

The world of crypto can be very confusing to people who are just starting out on their journey. All of the different block chains, trying to buy crypto with Fiat currency and then how to trade, let alone getting involved in new projects that simply never launch their product, rug pull, or simply fail instantly.

Trying to explain to someone how to buy a token can be very excruciating.

We also have found that trying to trade across blockchains (non-EVM), doesn't actually work very well and no one seems to have invented that all important flawless bridge yet.

We also found it very time consuming trying to get the best prices for our trades, checking different decentralized exchange for the best deals.

We have also found that existing NFT marketplaces are very crowded and finding decent content to be a problem.

Our most recent problems involved securing a value for money token contract audit, with the industry charging between $1,000-$10,000.
